	<!-- This hidden field is to keep the openScenarioBean alive in all the project tasks
		 such as duplication, editing aso. The initial reason was that a created scenario is
		 not added to the correct project after returning to the main screen, because
		 the OpenScenarioBean has been destroyed and recreated (because of being
		 ViewAccessScoped, which still makes sense).
